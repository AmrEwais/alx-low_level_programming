# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops


## Tasks

- **Note** for all these challenges we will not be using global variables and any standard library.
- We will be using function prototypes that will be included in our header file called, main.h.
- We are allowed to use the prototype funtion [\_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c).
