# 0x08. C - Recursion

## General

- What is recursion?
    - Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to accomplish a task. It can be thought of as a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met, but instead of being controlled by a counter variable, it is controlled by the function itself.
- How to implement recursion?
    - To implement recursion, a function needs to have a base case that stops the recursion from continuing infinitely. The function also needs to have a recursive case that calls itself with a modified input that brings it closer to the base case.
- In what situations you should implement recursion?
    - Recursion is useful in situations where a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are themselves the same kind of problem. For example, traversing a tree or searching through a maze can be done recursively.
- In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion?
    - However, recursion should not be used in situations where the performance cost of function calls and stack memory usage outweighs the benefits of using recursion. In these cases, an iterative approach may be more appropriate.
